# Client experience

Experience is independent of `WOW_CLIENT_PROFILE` (installed data) and the session protocol.
Without configuration, **Classic** is selected: every Plus feature is disabled, even if a feature
entry says `true`. This is the evaluation default. `WOW_EXPERIENCE=classic|plus` overrides only
the profile; invalid values stop boot rather than silently selecting a different experience.

The existing `BENILLA_HOME/config.toml` supports:

```toml
[experience]
profile = "plus"
packs = ["base-art", "my-art"] # ascending priority, later packs win
allow_classic_overrides = false

[experience.features]
asset_overrides = true
shadows = true
fog = true
bloom = true
tone_mapping = true
colour_grading = true
```

All registered features default on in Plus; each can be disabled separately. These are seams:
a registered feature only has an effect once its consumer is implemented. Unknown feature names
are rejected rather than silently misspelling a toggle. CVar saves preserve the experience table.
Capture runs ignore persistent player configuration, as they do for CVars; an explicit
`WOW_EXPERIENCE=plus` is needed to select Plus for a capture.

`experience::Experience` is the app's Bevy resource and the only feature-query API. Runtime callers
use `set_profile` and `set_feature`; switching back to Classic masks existing feature overrides.
Runtime changes are session-only and do not overwrite the boot configuration. Asset packs are
mounted at boot, not hot-reloaded. Classic asset overrides require a separate explicit
`allow_classic_overrides = true`; that permission never enables graphics features under Classic.

## Asset packs

Put enabled packs in `<home>/mods/<pack>/`, with loose paths mirroring MPQ paths, for example
`mods/my-art/World/KhazModan/Ironforge/PassiveDoodads/Trees/IronforgeLeaves01.blp`.
The `packs` list is ascending priority: its last copy wins, then the original archive chain is the
fallback. Paths compare case-insensitively with either slash separator. Pack names must be single
folder names; traversal, absolute paths, symlinks and ambiguous case-folded names are rejected.
Pack files are local trusted content, not sandboxed plugins. Mount names are snapshotted at boot;
do not move or mutate the pack tree while the client runs. An unreadable winning file is an error,
not a silent fallback to different art. Byte reads log the winning loose file's provenance.

The policy is resolved once by app boot. Classic never even scans configured packs without the
separate `allow_classic_overrides` permission. Ordinary `Chain::open`/`open_profile` calls and bare
UI test harnesses remain archive-only. Packs are not hot-mounted by runtime profile setters;
restart after changing pack configuration.

### Reader audit

- `Chain::read` (and its `read_file` alias), `contains`, `list` and `list_filtered` share one policy;
  enumeration includes pack-only paths and the winning loose file's size.
- The boot `mpq://` reader receives that policy before Bevy's asset plugin builds. BLP, M2, WMO,
  ADT and WDT loaders use it, including ADT layer byte dependencies and sampler-marked doodad
  textures. Directory enumeration on the Bevy source remains unsupported as before; these
  loaders request explicit paths, while chain clients use `list_filtered`.
- World startup applies the same policy to `WorldAssets`; its DBC/model/texture/audio reads all
  use that chain. Vanilla reference UI has an explicit pre-VM boot initializer for its independent
  once-per-process chain; standalone test VMs do not discover player packs.
- Skin compositing no longer uses a direct archive handle. Ambience streams select a loose file
  before taking the original MPQ streaming branch; Classic retains sector-at-a-time MPQ audio.
- Public archive-only asset-source registration functions intentionally keep their original
  defaults; the production launcher calls the explicit override registration function instead.
- Remaining independent chain opens in asset/world/model/UI/animation test modules and the
  `cfg(test)` WMO/light/liquid audit modules deliberately validate original installed data. The
  direct archive handle in the sound mixer is likewise in its installed-data test module.
- Addon-owned loose-file fallback is a separate existing mechanism, after the chain lookup; it
  does not shadow client archive files or enable a mod pack.

Live replacement captures (texture/model and Classic before/after) are performed by the manager;
the worker does not launch the client. Synthetic tests cover policy resolution and the full Bevy
texture-loading pipeline without installed Blizzard assets.
